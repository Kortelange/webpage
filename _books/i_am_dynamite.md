short_review: "In 'I am Dynamite - The Life of Friedrich Nietzsche', Susan Prideaux undertakes the task of charting Friedrich Nietzsche's life and philosophical ideas. Personally, I found some portions of the book less engaging, yet, as the narrative unfolded, it did gain some momentum. The title, 'I am dynamite', gradually revealed its significance, symbolizing the potential power and peril of Nietzsche's ideas, and pointing towards their unfortunate misinterpretations, notably their misuse by the Nazis."

Being a biography, the book naturally concentrates more on Nietzsche's life than on an in-depth analysis of his philosophical works. However, it did manage to spark my curiosity about "Ecce Homo" and "Antichrist". I was intrigued by the depiction of Jesus as a joyous anarchist whose teachings were later warped to encourage a 'slave mentality.' Equally compelling was Nietzsche's self-satire in "Ecce Homo."

Two points that caught my attention were Nietzsche's influence on Edvard Munch's iconic painting "The Scream" and the origin of the well-known phrase, "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," traced back to a Nietzschean aphorism.

The biography rounds off with a collection of Nietzsche's aphorisms and a detailed chronology of his life. While the chronology did not hold much interest for me, it could serve as a handy reference for others. As for the aphorisms, in my opinion, some of them appeared mundane or challenging to comprehend, potentially due to lack of context. However, a few did stand out as particularly thought-provoking:

- Possessions are usually diminished by possession - The Gay Science
- Whoever lives for the sake of combatting an enemy has an interest in the enemy's staying alive - Human, All Too Human
- He who thinks a lot is not well suited to be a party man: he thinks his way through the party and out the other side to soon - Human, All Too Human
- What does not kill me makes me stronger - Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer
- Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from themselves - Schopenhauer as Educator
- The state wants people to worship it in the very same idols they previously worshipped in the church - Schopenhauer as Educator
- Everything the state says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen - Thus spoke Zarathustra
