In his book, Coetzee  chronicles many of his expeditions and adventures, including the first full descent of the Nile, explorations in the Congo, and treks along the African West Coast. More than just a record of physical feats, his narrative weaves humor and humility into each story. Coetzee’s storytelling transcends adventure and is an introspective journey, reflecting on life's profound lessons learned amidst raging rivers, wildlife encounters, and the vast political complexities of the African continent.

This review explores the key themes emerging from the stories: confronting death, the contrasts of Western and African cultures, the enduring effects of race relations and colonialism, true freedom, and the difficulties of telling a story without affecting your adventure.

## Confronting Death and Embracing Life:

The natural danger of his expeditions makes reflections on confronting mortality a recurring theme in the book. He comments on how most Westerners are sheltered from death, which he believes creates a barrier to experiencing life to the fullest. On the other hand, staring down the jaws of a crocodile, being at gunpoint, or navigating treacherous rapids forces a presence in the moment and centers you on the minor but important things.

Coetzee also notes a stark difference in the perception of death and the loss of relatives in African and Western cultures. In the West, he observes, people often deal with loss in solitude and for extended periods of time, whereas in Africa, where death is a more normal event, people handle grief in a more public, but transient manner.

I prefer Coetzee's reflections on death to the more philosophical ones in [Death](./death.html) by Todd May due to the authenticity and immediacy with which Coetzee presents his experiences. They offer a more honest and relatable portrayal with valuable insights as opposed to theoretical musings.

## Contrasts and Reflections between African and Western Cultures
The book offers intriguing insights into the cultural contrasts between the West and Africa. Coetzee highlights the West's obsession with materialism, noting how this often leads to a perpetual state of wanting more, consequently becoming enslaved to time. Conversely, in many African countries, he observes people exhibiting contentment and resourcefulness, adeptly making the most of what they have. Ugandans in particular, are described as 'masters of time,' contrasting them with the time-bound mindset of Westerners. This observation leads to an ironic reflection: Westerners, often perceived as wealthy, appear impoverished in their relationship with time, the ultimate and scarcest resource.

Coetzee also explores the complex dynamics of race relations in Africa. He reflects on the continent's history, marred by exploitation and colonization by white people, and how, in contemporary Africa, being white often correlates with a perceived status of importance and wealth. This perception, he humorously notes, often results in a ‘white tax’ at borders or in bureaucratic encounters. His anecdotes about these experiences are a blend of humorous stories and more serious, even frightening, encounters. They leave a lasting impression of the extensive damage caused by imperialist exploitation and dictators.

## Beeing Free
Coetzee believes genuine freedom is inherently challenging, as it requires acceptance of the future's uncertainty. He observes that while many yearn for this freedom, they often stop at the edge of the unknown, opting for the comfort of predictability and safety instead. Coetzee portrays the quest for freedom as a solitary journey, filled with risks and doubts, but ultimately worth it for the fulfillment it brings.

## Storytelling and Adventure
In the final part of the book, Coetzee reflects on the motivations behind undertaking expeditions, highlighting the contrast between explorers who keep their journeys private and those who narrate their grand adventures. He discusses how the intention of telling a story can inherently change the experience, often leading to a version of events that is reshaped for the audience, rather than providing a true account of what occurred. He implies that this transformation can sometimes obscure the authentic essence of the adventure.

The divergence between 'the story told' and 'the true story' has become even more pronounced as social media has gained a solid foothold in everyday life over the last few years, with many people actively trying to portray a life they do not actually live.

Coetzee also examines the evolving desire for external validation. While he notes a general decrease in the need for approval with age, he admits that, ironically, his own craving for recognition has increased, yet he has become more aware of it. This introspection sheds light on the complex interplay between personal identity and the urge to share one's journey.

All in all, 'Living the Best Day Ever' is a thrilling journey through the wilds of Africa, offering inspiration and reflections on life. It is delivered with rawness and honesty, and it's a book that I will surely return to in the future.
