short_review: "A great book examining how fiat has affected society. It is a polarizing book that Bitcoin advocates might enjoy, while its skeptics will almost surely dismiss it. What I liked best about the book was Song’s breakdown of an invisible toll imposed by fiat: how fiat warps dreams, erodes morality and beliefs, and reduces work to mere compliance instead of value creation. In addition, the chapter <em>The Wrong Lesson of Pizza Day</em> is fantastic in illustrating how the destruction of these values has left us chasing luck instead of cultivating skill."

## Dreams, Morality, Beliefs and Work
Humans have a concept of what is naturally fair and just, leading to *natural/common law*. These are "obvious" rules such as *not stealing*, *not killing* etc that are ultimately derived from every person's right to govern their own body and mind (for more on this, see part 5 of Saifedeam Ammous' book [Principles of Economics](./principles_of_economics.html)). Governments must craft elaborate justifications to break these natural laws, then condition citizens to accept these contradictions without question. For this they need **compliant** citizens.

Compliance erodes morality and beliefs by design. Moral rightness becomes whatever the government decrees today ([*1984*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) "was not supposed to be an instruction manual"), rather than principles derived from deeply held values or individual critical thought. To sway with the government’s whims, citizens adopt superficial beliefs—turning into hollow actors like [Patrick Bateman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4hP6nOB1dc) from *American Psycho*, reciting approved slogans over dinner while having no morality.

How is work ruined? Fiat means *by decree*—through printing money, governments decree nonproductive jobs into existence. This shifts work away from market-driven jobs and entrepreneurship toward roles that charge for granting permission to act without providing value: [*rent-seeking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) jobs. While common in government bureaucracies, these roles also proliferate in private sectors through various channels.  

Lacking budgetary constraints, governments prioritize irrelevant (or outright crony) contracts over productive investments, rewarding loyalty and politicking rather than value creation. Under a fiat system, loans derived from monetary expansion force companies to seek compliance for access to cheap capital. Compliant jobs reward politicking and flexible morals, equating these traits with success.  

Another perverse effect of easy loans is the *bait-and-switch* business model: companies offer *free* services at unsustainable losses to crush smaller competitors lacking access to financialization, then pivoting to monetize user data (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon).  

These forces collectively ruin dreams. Compliance being as the easiest path to “success,” entangles our aspirations with arbitrary career goals that carve paths into meaninglessness. Self-inflicted debt further enslaves us to the [rat race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NwQmNg9kv8), blinding us to former dreams through the *necessity* of endless payments.  

The solution lies in adopting the lifestyle of a [**"Toxic Maximalist"**](https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/bitcoiners-are-not-toxic-they-have-integrity-bd866d2773e9)—living by unyielding values and holding those around you to equally uncompromising standards.  

## The Wrong Lesson of Pizza Day
*Pizza Day* celebrates the first real-world Bitcoin transaction: Laszlo Hanyecz’s 2010 purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin. Many of us (myself included) fantasize about being the pizza-delivery guy who got rich through sheer luck—not the innovator like Hanyecz, who reinvented Bitcoin mining. We fixate on the pizzas (an easy job requiring only right-place-right-time serendipity) while ignoring the technical mastery behind earning those coins.  

Hanyecz pioneered GPU mining—a technically demanding breakthrough that let him mine Bitcoin faster and cheaper than competitors. This achievement required skills honed through years of work and study. Song argues we should aspire to emulate Hanyecz’s skill-building rather than covet the delivery guy’s luck. True value, he stresses, comes from cultivating abilities that provide market value and thus benefit society.  

Song then gives a humbling insight: even if we’d been that delivery guy, most would’ve lost the Bitcoin—selling early, misplacing keys, or falling for scams. It’s ironic how non-holders today imagine they’d have both recognized Bitcoin’s potential **and** securely stored it since 2010. This chapter forces humility: understanding Bitcoin’s value, acquiring it, and safeguarding it demand effort. But once achieved, it rewards with freedom.
