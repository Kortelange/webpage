short_review: "\"A Man for All Markets\" is the autobiography of Edward Thorp, a mathematician and hedge fund manager who revolutionized the world of gambling by inventing a blackjack system that could beat the dealer. Along with Claude Shannon, he built the world's first wearable computer and later became a very successful hedge fund manager by applying ideas from information theory to the stock market. His book contains valuable insights into Thorp's thought process and approach to problem-solving, particularly throughout the early chapters on his youth. These formative experiences not only shaped his personality but also laid the foundation for his future successes in beating the casinos and stock markets around the world. What I find particularly inspiring about Thorp's story is that it shows how a curious and analytical mind can achieve greatness in multiple fields, and how his methods can be used by anyone looking to improve their own problem-solving skills."

Thorp's way of obtaining knowledge is very different from the way it is done in schools today. First, it seems to always come from genuine curiosity and Thorp asking questions that he does not know how to answer instead of being told what to learn and why. Thorp's way of asking questions himself leads to a second differentiation; when learning something, he gets to it from first principles, deriving what he can and trying to build something (often a prank). In this way, he gets a deep and long-lasting intuition for how things work under the hood, instead of a shallow recollection of facts.

Thorp's way of questioning everything is remarkable and inspiring. He notes that there are often good questions to be asked in areas where there is a lot of "common knowledge" but little actual understanding. This is illustrated by his experience with blackjack, where he tried out a strategy developed by mathematicians, only to be ridiculed at the table for his plays. This ridicule made him realize that most players didn't truly understand the game, and that a winning strategy might be possible. From his youth, Thorp had been wondering whether beating roulette was possible due to the fact that a player could bet for some time after the ball was rolling and thereby gain an edge. When Richard Feynman told him that this was impossible, Thorp similarly knew it was a great question. His work on blackjack and roulette led to a collaboration with Claude Shannon, with whom he built the first wearable computer, designed to beat roulette. For more on Shannon see Soni's book [A Mind at Play](./a_mind_at_play.html).

Thorp's inquisitive nature led him to test his ideas in practice, moving from theoretical concepts to real-world experimentation. The stories of these adventures are super fun, filled with the drama and corruption you would expect, but also illustrate the difference between theory and practice. In theory, it was possible to play his strategy perfectly, but in practice, a casino losing money would find ways to get rid of him. As a result, Thorp and his partners had to employ clever communication strategies and disguises, as well as avoid winning too much to avoid arousing suspicion.

Thorp's successful blackjack endeavors left him with a surplus, which he didn't want to let idle. This led him to an even greater casino - the stock market. He developed methods to price various options and securities, leveraging insights from information theory, including the "Kelly Criterion", to optimize the size of his bets (for more on this, see the book [Fortune's Formula](./fortunes_formula.html)). As a fund manager, Thorp achieved enormous success, with a streak of 30 non-losing years! He emphasizes that position sizing is at least as important as finding good bets, and that investing well is not just about maximizing returns, but also about avoiding significant losses when you need your money most.

The final part of the book is not as engaging as the first, mainly because it delves into detailed explanations of concepts like compounded gains, which can be dry for readers already familiar with them. Despite this, Thorp's original insights remain highly valuable. A notable example is how he uncovered Bernie Madoff's scam more than 10 years before it was exposed. Thorp's approach was surprisingly straightforward: he analyzed the supposed trades and found them nonsensical. He then verified with brokers whether these trades were actually being executed - and they weren't. This episode highlights a disturbing fact: despite being a regulated fund, no one had bothered to scrutinize the books.

The most compelling aspect of this final section is Thorp's decision to quit his job as a fund manager when he no longer found it interesting. Having amassed sufficient wealth to retire comfortably, he realized that his time was no longer well-spent on work. Thorp notes that many people become trapped in a cycle of pursuing more wealth, losing sight of what truly matters.

In conclusion, Thorp's story offers a valuable lesson: the importance of understanding things from the bottom up, rather than just accepting surface-level explanations. By questioning assumptions vigorously and being aware of areas where "common knowledge" might be flawed, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and make more informed decisions. Stay humble and keep track of what is important.
