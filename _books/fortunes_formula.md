short_review: "'Fortune’s Formula' tells the story of how information theorists tackled the challenge of beating the casino and stock markets. The book starts with a brief biography of Claude Shannon and his development of information theory. It then introduces other key figures, Edward Thorpe and John Kelly.

The core theme is the 'Kelly Criterion', developed by John Kelly, which determines the optimal bet for compound growth. This criterion translates Shannon’s capacity theorems, about the optimal rate of information transmission through a classical information channel, into guidelines for betting."

The 'information channel' refers to the extra knowledge you gain relative to the average investor per unit of time. The Kelly Criterion explains that this channel's capacity is the optimal growth rate; receiving one bit of information leads, at most, to an expected compounding of 100% over this period.

As an example consider a "fair" horse racing track with eight horses, labeled A through H, all presumed to have an equal chance of winning. The payout for each horse is set at eight to one, reflecting the track's fairness. If you come into possession of information indicating that horses A to D each have a 25% chance of winning, while the chances for the remaining four horses are nil, you could strategically place a $1 bet on each of the horses A to D. Consequently, you would win $8 in every round, achieving a growth rate of 100%. Given that the information received constitutes 1 bit, the Kelly Criterion deems this betting strategy as optimal.

One thing I found fascinating about the Kelly Criterion is its conservative nature, highlighting that to maximize growth, one must never go bankrupt. It suggests that even if you keep half your portfolio in cash and bet the other half optimally, you can still expect good returns while reducing risk/volatility significantly. This approach might be especially appealing to older individuals for whom a large financial shock could have serious implications.

There is also a good discussion on how many economists critique the Kelly Criterion for various reasons. Many of the reasons are valid in that Kelly betting might not be optimal given your life situation, for example, if your salary is high relative to what you have to invest, a more aggressive strategy could be beneficial.

Interestingly, some of the major critics ended up working at "Long Term Capital Management," a fund that spectacularly failed and was bailed out in 1998. For those interested in learning more about "Long Term Capital Management," the book "When Genius Failed" provides an in-depth look. The major critic, Paul Samuelson, also consistently predicted from 1961 that the USSR would surpass the United States, a stance that reveals much about his understanding of economics. Conversely, those who adopted the strategy of Kelly betting, such as Edward Thorpe, experienced significant success in managing their funds.

I really enjoyed how William Poundstone made the concepts clear, offering a solid intro to the ideas and history. I'm certainly keen to explore the math behind it further.
