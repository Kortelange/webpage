short_review: "Walden entails Henry David Thoreau's two years living in a cabin he built near Walden pond in Massachussets. It is a thought-provoking book that explores the essentials of a good life and what it means to live in the present. After finishing the book, I felt an even stronger desire to live a simple yet fulfilling life, engaged in activities I enjoy with people I like, and free from the burdens of a traditional career."

I was drawn to "Walden" because it was a major inspiration for two of my favorite books: [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](./zen_and_motorcycle_maintenance.html) and [Digital Minimalism](./digital_minimalism.html). Both books discuss the importance of disconnecting from society's constant influx of information and duty and embracing a more focused, peaceful lifestyle that connects us with nature and craftsmanship.

## Economy
The first part of the book examines the costs of living in Thoreau's cabin near Walden Pond. Laying out his budget he shows that the cabin could be constructed for about one year's worth of rent. Thoreau argues that people often become enslaved by their possessions and expensive habits, deceiving themselves into thinking that life must be complicated and costly. He contends that it's possible to live a simple and fulfilling life with minimal expenses. My two key takeaways from this chapter are Thoreau's definition of cost as "*the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run*", and his observation that it doesn't take much to fulfill life's basic needs. Once these needs are met, individuals can truly start living.

On the idea of prioritizing life over material possessions, Thoreau writes: "When he has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced."

Regarding construction and self-sufficiency, he notes: "But alas! we do like cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in nests which other birds have built, and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical notes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter? What does architecture amount to in the experience of the mass of men? ... ... ... No doubt another *may* also think for me, but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself."

On education and its cost, he observes: "I cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these respects, not only less education would be needed, because, forsooth, more would already have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a great measure vanish." And confronting the question of college funding and what students should occupy themselves with: "they should not *play* life, or *study* it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living?"

He also comments on our need for fancy things: "Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at."

Finally, on the relationship between people and their possessions, he writes: "I am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are the keepers of men, the former are so much the freer."

## Alive and awake
Thoreau argues that many people are not truly alive, but rather exist in a state of partial wakefulness, just enough to perform their daily tasks. He provocatively suggests that most individuals are asleep to the possibility of living a divine life, one where they carve their own path and create their own meaning. However, he ultimately concludes that it is possible to "wake up" from this societal slumber and gain a beautiful and present life.

On the idea of creating a beautiful life, Thoreau writes: "It is something to be able to paint a particular picture or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do."

On the experience of being alive: "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to find only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear."

On the importance of living in the present moment, he observes: "A single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener. So our prospects brightens on the influx of better thoughts. We should be blessed if we lived in the present always, and took advantage of every accident that befell us, like the grass which confesses the influence of the slightest dew that falls on it; and did not spend our time atoning for the neglect of past opportunities, which we call doing our duty."

Finally, on the possibility of waking up or coming back to life, Thoreau writes: "Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well seasoned tomb -- heard perchance gnawing out for years by the astonished family of man, as they sat round the festive board -- may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society's most trivial and handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer of life at last! ... ... ... Only that day dawns to which we are awake".

## Solitude, society and reading

Thoreau's thoughts on solitude, society, and reading are characteristically provocative. He argues that people often meet too frequently, without having anything new or meaningful to share with one another. Additionally, he believes that the reading people do is too easy, serving only to occupy their time, stay updated on "current events", or maintain their language, rather than to engage with literature and higher thoughts. Thoreau also critiques the government's role in limiting individual freedom and notes that many citizens are unaware of the purpose behind various government institutions.

On the nature of solitude, Thoreau writes: "What sort of space is that which separates a man from his fellows and makes him solitary? I have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another."

Regarding social interactions, he observes: "Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other."

On people's disregard for literature, Thoreau writes: "A man, any man will go considerably out of his way to pick up a silver dollar; but there are golden words, which the wisest men of antiquity have uttered, and whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us of; -- and yet we learn to read only as far as Easy Reading, the primers and class-books, and when we leave school, the 'Little Reading,' and story-books, which are for boys and beginners; and out reading, our conversation and thinking, are all on a very low level, worthy only of pygmies and manikins."

Thoreau also values practical wisdom over theoretical knowledge, as seen in his comment on a "simple" woodchopper: "He could defend many institutions better than any philosopher, because, in describing them as they concerned him, he gave the true reason for their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to him any other."

On the concept of liberty in society, he notes: "he had rated it as a gain in coming to America, that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only true America is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these and where the state does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the use of such things."

Finally, on people's tendency to try to impress one another, Thoreau wryly comments: "but a goose is a goose still, dress it as you will."


## Conclusion
This is a provocative but fantastic book. It is one best enjoyed slowly, allowing for the thoughts and poetic sentences to seep in. Much like [Meditations](./meditations.html) by **Marcus Aurelius**, it is a timeless book that, apart from the language, might as well have been written today. The language is colorful, with beautifully constructed sentences, making it an experience to read.
