short_review: "\"A Mind at Play\" is a captivating and inspiring account of Claude Shannon's life, the brilliant mind behind the birth of information theory. From his early days to his groundbreaking work, the book vividly illustrates the unique traits that, alongside his intellect, propelled Shannon to his monumental discoveries. It also does an excellent job of breaking down the basics of information theory into layman’s terms."

I really enjoyed the early sections of the book, which explore mechanical and analog computers. These early machines could only solve one problem at a time and had to be reassembled for new tasks. Shannon’s master’s thesis, often referred to as the most important master’s thesis of the 20th century, was groundbreaking as he connected Boolean logic to circuits, enabling the creation of digital computers using switches. By working with these early computers, Shannon’s insight allowed us to ask general questions to the same machine, a significant advancement.

Shannon’s advisor, Vannevar Bush, also stands out as an interesting character. His influence on Shannon was significant, and I would like to learn more about Bush’s thoughts on engineering.

Knowing some information theory before, I also appreciated learning more about Shannon’s inspirations, Nyquist and Hartley. They helped in “discretizing” continuous signals and bridged the ideas from entropy in thermodynamics to information, or Shannon entropy.

One takeaway from the book is just how skilled Shannon was at simplifying complex problems by using abstractions. From Boolean logic and switches to separating “meaning” from “information," these abstractions enabled clearer descriptions of signal processing tools. Moreover, Shannon's application of abstract thinking extended to an algebra of genes, even before the discovery of DNA. These examples show how effective abstractions can simplify problems and accelerate their solutions significantly.

Besides his intellect, Shannon had some very inspiring traits. Despite his opportunities for fame and stardom, he lived a humble life and avoided hyping or misrepresenting his results. When everyone was celebrating “information theory” as a solution to everything, Shannon advised caution and pointed out several unresolved issues. He didn't confine himself to a specific field but continually explored topics that piqued his interest. This curiosity led him to create playful inventions like unicycles and flamethrowing trumpets, as well as pioneering projects like the world’s first chess computer and the first maze-navigating artificial intelligence, “Theseus.”

His diverse interests also led him to explore gambling and the stock market, which is covered in more detail in William Poundstones book [Fortune's formula](./fortunes_formula.html). Shannon co-developed the first wearable computer with Thorp, which they used to improve their odds at the roulette table. It's amusing that his most attended lecture was on the stock market. I really like Shannon's comment that "technical analysis" is not a reliable investment method, comparing it to a noisy signal. Instead, he recommended focusing on the fundamentals of a company and investing in areas where you have special knowledge or, as he called it, "inside information."

The section about life at Bell Labs is also interesting. Here, “The Idea Factory” by Jon Gertner is supposed to be a good source. 

Shannon was truly inspiring, and it’s quite amazing to read the book and discover just how many important—and often groundbreaking—discoveries he made, all while staying humble and kind.
