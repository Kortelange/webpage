short_review: "Breatheology (træk vejret) by Stig Åvall Severinsen provides an insightful exploration into the transformative power of breath and its substantial impact on our health, well-being, and overall performance. Through a seamless integration of scientific insights and practical exercises, the book demystifies the art of breathwork—from the fundamental mechanics of our respiratory system to its influential role in stress management, disease treatment, and pain alleviation. Severinsen, a renowned free diver, enthusiastically advocates for integrating breathwork into daily routines and underscores the value of using these breathing exercises as a complementary addition to traditional medical treatments.

I found the book compelling and it has inspired me to try the proposed techniques. While I'm yet to fully engage with these practices, I'm motivated to document my progress as I practice the techniques further."

# Documentation/progress
(2023/07/29) - Been doing some exercises for about a week now, feel slight progress in my 'natural breath rythm'

(2023/10/22) - My natural breathing rhythm has improved, now steady at 10 breaths every three minutes when relaxed. Additionally, my 'Ujjayi' breathing technique has progressed: a consistent pattern of a 4-second inhale, an 8-second hold, an 8-second exhale, and another 8-second hold. I've also begun integrating 'Mula Bandha' or 'Root Lock' into this routine.

(2024/01/23) - I have realized that at some point I have stopped doing my morning routine. Having felt slightly sad for a short period I have decided to incorporate 'Ujjayi' breathing in my breaks at work, as I am usually alone in the office til around 12, this is quite easy. Starting out again, my technique is significantly worse compared to last.

(2024/01/31) - After one of my friends told me that he had experimented with some of the 'energizing' breathing techniques found in the book I have decided to give it a go as well. The past two days I have been doing the exercise 'Kapalabhati' when I start to lose concentration at work. It is interesting and it seems that I clear my head and gain the ability to focus for a while longer without spending much time doing this. It will be interesting to see how it works out in the long run.  

## Chapter 1:
This chapter tackles stress management in daily life, distinguishing between short-term 'good stress' induced by activities like exercise and long-term 'bad stress' from persistent high alert states. It proposes breathwork as an effective tool for mitigating stress, emphasizing that controlling one's breath can provide positive feedback, similar to how poor stress management negatively affects well-being. The chapter concludes with helpful dietary suggestions and a simple relaxation exercise performed while lying supine.

## Chapter 2:
This chapter delves into the fundamental workings of our respiratory system, particularly the lungs and breathing process. It also outlines the sympathetic (triggered by stress) and parasympathetic (activated by calm) nervous systems, and how slow, controlled breathing can stimulate the parasympathetic system through the vagus nerve. To help gauge personal stress levels, the chapter offers exercises for identifying your natural breathing rhythm and suggests tracking this rhythm over time.

## Chapter 3:
This chapter explores the foundation of yoga and its inherent connection to breath control. It presents yoga breathing techniques as practical exercises to enhance one's mindfulness and control over respiration.

## Chapter 4:
The art of breath-holding takes the spotlight in this chapter, emphasizing the mental aspect: it's not what you think about, but how you think that matters. Maintaining a relaxed mindset is key. To supplement the theory, the chapter concludes with an introduction to pranayama exercises, a significant component of yoga focusing on breath control.

## Chapter 5:
This chapter addresses how to expand lung capacity and improve overall respiratory function. It discusses the benefits of such improvements, especially in the context of athletic performance, suggesting that enhanced air capacity can provide a competitive edge in various sports.

## Chapter 6:
This chapter delves into the substantial impact of breathing techniques on various health issues, with a particular focus on asthma. It underscores how, for asthma patients, targeted breathwork can significantly diminish the need for medication and, in some cases, potentially contribute to a full disease remission. Importantly, the author emphasizes that breathwork should be perceived as a complementary strategy, enhancing but not replacing conventional medical treatments provided by healthcare institutions. The chapter wraps up with a compelling account of how the author supplemented a friend's standard medical treatment and physiotherapy for Borrelia with customized breathwork.

## Chapter 7:
This chapter explores the role of breathwork in pain management across diverse scenarios, including childbirth, chronic pain, illness, and elderly care. It proposes that strategic breathing techniques can alleviate discomfort and enhance overall well-being. It rounds off with a selection of practical exercises designed to provide pain relief.

## Chapter 8:
The chapter initiates with a basic first aid guide before transitioning into building a personalized breathwork routine. The author suggests that just 10-20 minutes daily can yield noticeable improvements. The proposed routine is divided into four phases utilizing exercises from previous chapters:

1. Mental and physical warmup (2-5 minutes).
2. Breathing exercises (5-30 minutes).
3. Meditation and relaxation (2-10 minutes).
4. Prayer or contemplation (1-5 minutes).
