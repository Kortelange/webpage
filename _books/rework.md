short_review: "In 'Rework,' Jason Fried and Jamie Heinemeier Hansson challenge conventional ideas about work in the 21st century. The principles laid out are general and often apply outside of work as well. I found the book thought-provoking, and its clear, concise writing makes it easy to revisit for brushing up on the core concepts."

My main takeaway is to keep things simple. Focus on doing less, but doing it better. For example, the authors explain that in their software company, they prioritized having fewer buttons and functions in their products. This approach not only made the product cheaper to develop but also kept the focus on the user's core needs, creating a better user experience. While this might sound obvious, we often add too much flexibility to our products, overcomplicating them and increasing their cost. We forget that, much of the time, people are actually paying to have complexity taken out of their hands.

There are many other interesting discussions throughout the book, covering topics such as meetings, hiring, working hours, and capitalizing on work that has already been done. Simplicity and trimming away what is unnecessary apply here as well:

- Do you really need this meeting, and how many man-hours does it occupy?
- How many people do you really need for the job, and what is the main skill required?
- Can you create a useful product out of something that you have already made? For example, 'Rework' itself was compiled from blog posts.

The book was great, and I might flesh out further ideas on a second read-through, but for now, I will adhere to the style of the book and keep it short.
