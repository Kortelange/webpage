This period isn't just about a detox but about reassessing the digital tools you use. After 30 days, you reintroduce these tools and notice their benefits, if any. Following my own declutter, I had many realizations about how digital media influences my daily life and what changes I needed to make. The book is filled with practical advice on how to best implement the declutter and why it's a good idea to do one."

The main point of the book is that many people have poor digital habits and need to take a break to improve them. Newport suggests a 30-day digital declutter, where you either avoid digital media or use it minimally—just enough to handle work and essential communication. After the declutter, you reintroduce digital tools one at a time to evaluate their contribution to your life.

To succeed in the 30-day declutter, there are a few key things to keep in mind. The rules should be strict enough to make a difference but flexible enough to accommodate your essential needs. They should also be clear to prevent slip-ups. For instance, you might limit checking and sending emails to specific times, like between 9:00-9:30 AM and 3:00-3:30 PM. If there's a particular show you enjoy, you could also allow yourself to watch one episode per week.

Another crucial aspect is finding activities to fill the time freed up from less digital media use. This could include playing a new sport, practicing an instrument, reading books, or cooking.

One of the main points of the book is that smartphones are engineered to hack your brain. To combat this, Newport suggests either getting a “dumbphone” or turning your smartphone into one. Luckily, phone companies have made this easier. On an iPhone, for example, you can remove unnecessary apps and use “Screen Time” and “Restrictions” to block most webpages.

Another realization is that you can benefit simply by not looking at your phone as much. One trick I used during my own declutter was to rely on a separate timer, like a watch or eggtimer, when I'm working.

Doing the 30-day declutter was an interesting experiment. I usually listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks. Initially, I felt an urge to listen to something so I wouldn’t “miss out,” but after a week or two, I stopped caring and felt calmer without the need to “catch up.”

I still appreciate audiobooks and podcasts a lot, but after reintroducing them, I decided to separate my listening. Now, I don’t listen to podcasts when I have an unfinished audiobook. Additionally, I go one week a month without any audiobooks or podcasts.

For the declutter, I turned my phone into a “dumbphone” by blocking webpages by default and removing all apps except for weather, maps, and a few messaging and payment apps. Interestingly, I often grabbed my phone and unlocked it, even though there was nothing to check—well, except the weather, which I became an expert on that first week!
I’ve decided to keep my phone “dumb,” installing apps like “Primal” or “Twitter” only once a week to check up on what the few people I follow have posted, and then deleting them. For anything else, a computer is usually nearby. And if something is not important enough to check on a computer, it’s not important at all.

Some apps, like Instagram, I still haven't reinstalled. When I used it before, I made a weekly post about something I had enjoyed, something that characterized the week. This helped me take more photos and find something to appreciate each week. I also enjoyed the communication with distant friends and relatives it provided.
The reason I haven’t reinstalled it yet is that I don’t have a clear plan for its use. I still plan to post approximately once a week but with a few more restrictions. I’ll follow fewer people and stop liking posts, which I find to be an empty interaction. Instead, I’ll engage in real dialogues through commenting.
A funny thing I’ve noted is how Instagram really stops being interesting when you don’t use it. This app is a true brain-hacker.

Taking a step back also provides useful insights on how to build tools to improve your experience. For example, you could create a YouTube plugin that removes recommendations, a Facebook scraper that notifies you of events without needing to sign in, or an event plugin for other messaging platforms, removing the need for Facebook altogether (since I find events the only interesting aspect of Facebook).

All in all, I really liked the book. It's thoughtful and practical, with each chapter offering useful tips and tricks for improving your online experience.
