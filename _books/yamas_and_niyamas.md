short_review: "'The Yamas and Niyamas' is a book exploring the ethical practice of yoga, providing guidelines for living. While it contains many good ideas, I find them fairly standard for self-help books. It’s a short book, which is nice, but it could be even shorter as the stories aren’t very deep and the language is somewhat fluffy."

 One thing I liked about the book is the weekly questions for reflection. Each Yama and Niyama has four exercises, each requiring a week of attention, totaling 40 weeks of reflection. This acknowledges that personal change takes time and is not a [weekend retreat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J56hIpUJ3BM). I plan to try them and journal my thoughts along the way.

So far, I am six weeks into the exercises, with a few of them providing positive surprises. I will add these experiences later on.

The book starts by briefly explaining what the Yamas and Niyamas are. In Ashtanga yoga, there are eight limbs, two of which are the Yamas and Niyamas. The Yamas are 'restraints' and comprise five guidelines: nonviolence, truthfulness, nonstealing, nonexcess, and nonpossessiveness. The Niyamas are 'observances' and also consist of five guidelines: purity, contentment, self-discipline, self-study, and surrender. Each Yama and Niyama along with their exercises will be described below.

## The Yamas

### Ahimsa - Nonviolence 
Nonviolence is pretty straightforward, but the book offers an interesting twist. It points out that we can cause 'violence' to others when we're trying to help them. This happens because we see things from our perspective and thus our ‘help’ might differ from what is needed. The book compares this to taking a fish out of water to prevent it from drowning. It is a powerful idea, illustrating that we should always try to see situations from the perspectives of others before interfering.

### Satya - Truthfulness
Truthfulness is about being honest and authentic, which is no easy task. The book suggests that sometimes being truthful means dropping the need to please others or be nice, and instead just being real. You can of course try to be real in a kind way, but the priority is authenticity.

A deeper layer to truthfulness is to identify the stories you tell yourself about why you are the way you are and why you behave as you do. This self-reflection can be challenging but revealing.

One idea I really liked was "doing things right the first time." This is about acting in a way that doesn't require corrections or apologies later, like planning meetings in a way so that they don’t need rescheduling. 

The book points out that being authentic and truthful is often harder than fitting in or lying. This difficulty can be a useful indicator: if you're picking the easy choice, you might not be being truly authentic. It is an interesting way to check in with yourself and your actions.


### Asteya - Nonstealing
Nonstealing goes beyond just not taking physical things. The book presents some interesting perspectives on this concept. One idea I found particularly insightful is how we can 'steal' from others in everyday conversations by 'trumping' their arguments and stories. It's a subtle form of theft that many of us might not recognize.

Another compelling point is about avoiding stealing from the future. This involves leaving behind a world with better opportunities rather than depleting resources for short-term gain. I find this idea aligns well with the concept of building versus consuming capital, which is explored in [Principles of Economics](./principles_of_economics.html) and [Bitcoin is Venice](./bitcoin_is_venice.html).


### Brahmacharya - Nonexcess
Nonexcess is about realizing your addictions. In this context, addictions are what you do in excess (for whatever reason, including enjoyment). The key point is that your addictions are controlling you rather than the other way around.

In today's world, a common addiction many people struggle with is to media and screens. For those interested in tackling this specific issue, Cal Newport's [Digital Minimalism](./digital_minimalism.html) is a great resource.


### Aparigraha - Nonpossessiveness
Nonpossessiveness is about learning to let go and allowing things to move. It is closely related to your addictions in the sense that just like your addictions control you, your possessions possess you. Can you let go of your addictions? The image of nonpossessiveness presented in the book is the breath, something that is ever-changing. A good book on breathwork is Stig Åvall Severinsen's [Breathology](./breatheology.html).

## The Niyamas

### Saucha - Purity
Purity is about doing things properly and accepting things as they are, rather than chasing the ideals we sometimes envision. At a basic level, this could mean fixing your diet or cleaning up after yourself. On a deeper level, it's about being fully committed to what you're doing and accepting the slowness often required to create something of quality.

This concept of purity and quality is closely connected to ideas explored in [Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance](./zen_and_motorcycle_maintenance.html) and [Handmade](./handmade.html).

Being immersed in the moment is another aspect of purity. It's linked to accepting things as they are, which can help deconstruct our illusions and ideals about how a moment "should" be.

### Santosha - Contentment
Contentment is easy when things are going well, but what about when they're not? The main idea behind contentment is realizing that life is a process with ups and downs, and then being at peace with this process.

It's important to note that contentment doesn't mean ignoring problems. Instead, it's about taking responsibility and either doing something about the issues you face or accepting the situation as it is.

### Tapas - Self-discipline
Self-discipline is the practice of building skills and character that prepare you for life. It involves practicing necessary specific skills, but also staying with discomfort, thus preparing you for challenging situations.

Tapas is exemplified by [Tyler Durden giving his schizophrenic alter ego a chemical burn in "Fight Club"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvtUrjfnSnA), telling him to stay with the pain and not escape through meditation. This could be the greatest moment of his life, yet he's mentally elsewhere, not living it.


### Svadhyaya - Self-study
We usually look outside ourselves to explain our discomforts, blaming others and the world. The reality is that most of our discomfort arises from a discrepancy between how we view the world and how the world actually is. Svadhyaya is about not being afraid to look inside, recognizing these differences, and doing something about them. It also involves acknowledging that, many times, when you find fault with or judge others, this stems from something you dislike within yourself.

### Ishvara Pranidhana - Surrender
Surrendering is about flowing with life instead of fighting against it. It means being lighthearted and playful, ready to absorb the lessons that life brings you, rather than always being careful, concerned, and becoming angry when things don't go your way. Surrendering is not about giving up or not caring, but rather accepting and floating with the events that happen and working with them. In many ways, it embodies the previous nine guidelines, requiring truth, discipline, self-knowledge, contentment, and staying committed to the moment.
