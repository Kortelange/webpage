short_review: "In 'The Coming Wave,' Mustafa Suleyman explores the potential and risks of technologies like AI, genetic engineering, quantum computing, and nanotechnology. He argues these could drastically change our society and makes the point that we need strategies for potentially containing the technologies and managing the changes they will bring."

Suleyman, as a co-founder of DeepMind which built AlphaGo, provides solid insights into AI. He recounts the stories of how they built AlphaGo and AlphaFold and how they were surprised by how quickly these programs became the best at their respective tasks. He uses this to make the point that with AI and innovation in general, you never now what is around the corner.

While Suleyman is an expert in AI, his expertise does not extend to the other fields he discusses. For example, he portrays the future existence of quantum computers as nearly certain. Significant doubts persist, however, about whether such machines will ever be built (for a critic's perspective, read Mikhail Dyakonov's 'Will we ever have a quantum computer'). His treatment of this subject leaves me skeptical about his discussions on the remaining fields outside his expertise.

One aspect of the book I really appreciated was the stories of previous technological revolutions and innovations. However, many of these stories are covered better in Matt Ridley' fantastic book, 'How Innovation Works', although not all.

Another aspect I liked was the discussion on strategies for containing these technologies, found in the last part of the book. Although I don’t necessarily agree with every point made, I appreciated the nuanced approach. It went beyond mere regulation to offer practical suggestions, like the use of decoupled 'sandboxes' during the development of these technologies.

I agree with Suleyman that emerging technologies may indeed weaken the current system of nation-states, but I don’t believe this is inherently negative. If these technologies are adopted voluntarily and can deliver services equivalent to those provided by the state, but at a cheaper rate, that could actually be beneficial. To achieve this, we need to discuss how to handle these technologies responsibly, and therefore, Suleyman’s previous discussions on containment strategies are still relevant. I am also not worried that technology will push people out of work, a point that is well articulated in Chapter 7 of Saifedean Ammous’ excellent book, [Principles of Economics](./principles_of_economics.html).

In the end, I wasn't a huge fan of this book. While there were some interesting parts, it didn't leave me with any significant new insights.
